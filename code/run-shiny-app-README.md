This R script changes the working directory to the provided file path and executes the Shiny application in the same directory.

The setwd() method is used to set the working directory to the supplied file path, allowing the application to access the 
necessary files and resources.

runApp() is used to execute the Shiny application located in the working directory. Ensure that the required libraries and 
dependencies are installed before starting the programme.

It is essential to note that the supplied file path is particular to the user's local system and must be modified if the script is 
to be executed on a different system.

To run the application, open the script in R studio and click "Run" to execute the script. This will open the programme in 
Rstudio's viewer window.
