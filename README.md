The R function loads the "BMX D.csv" and "DEMO D.csv" CSV files into the "BMX" and "DEMO" data frames, respectively. It then 
generates "BMX new" and "DEMO new" by picking columns from the original data frames.

The chosen columns for "BMX new" are "SEQN" and "BMXBMI," while for "DEMO new", they are "SEQN," "RIAGENDR," "RIDAGEYR," "RIDRETH1," "DMDBORN," "DMDCITZN," and "DMDYRSUS."
The code renames the columns of the new data frames to make them more comprehensible.

Then, the two new data frames, "BMX new" and "DEMO new", are merged by the common column "SEQN" into a new data frame named "BMX 
DEMO."

The code then generates additional factors/categories depending on the column values of the "BMX DEMO" data frame. For example, 
the "AGE" column is first categorised as "10 Years", "11-20 Years", "21-30 Years", "31-45 Years", "46-60 Years", "61-80 Years", 
and ">80 Years".

Additionally, the values 1 and 2 in the "GENDER" column are converted to "Male" and "Female".

The "BMI" column is then categorised as "Underweight," "Healthy weight," "Overweight," and "Obesity."

In addition, the "RACE/ETHNICITY" column is categorised as "Mexican American," "Other Hispanic," "Non-Hispanic White," 
"Non-Hispanic Black," and "Other Race - Including Multiracial." In addition, the "COUNTRY OF BIRTH" column is categorised as "Born 
in 50 US States or Washington, DC", "Born in Mexico", "Born Elsewhere", and "Refused," while the "CITIZENSHIP STATUS" column is 
categorised as "Citizen by birth or naturalisation", "Not a citizen."

The final product is a data frame titled "BMX DEMO" that comprises demographic and BMI information that has been classified 
according to many parameters, including age, gender, BMI, race, country of birth, and citizenship status. This may be beneficial 
for examining data patterns and associations.
